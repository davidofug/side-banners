# side-banners
Very simple WordPress plugin for helping you add banners to left and right side of your WordPress website. You can upload the banners
to the media library and assign it to the left or right of your website without coding anything

Even if you want different banners, at the right or left, just do it. If you want to show the left but not the right banner, 
you can still do it. By checking the Turn on/off checkbox of every banner.

With this plugin you have the ability to set the width of the banners

Just test it and you will love it.
